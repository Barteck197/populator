Your best plugin for graphics personalization in figma.

## Main idea

To have a plugin that would take a csv database (or excel) and load each of the texts into the dedicated place on separate graphics. Using this plugin you should be able to create n graphics with different texts in the same place. You could generate this way: vouchers, video covers, party invitations, etc.
